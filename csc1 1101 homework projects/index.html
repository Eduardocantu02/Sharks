    <h1>The Fascinating World of Sharks</h1>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>Welcome to my shark page! Sharks are some of the most remarkable and misunderstood creatures of the ocean. 
    With over 500 different species, ranging from the small dwarf lanternshark to the massive whale shark, sharks have 
    evolved into some of the ocean's most skilled hunters. Sharks play a critical role in maintaining the balance of 
    marine ecosystems by keeping populations of fish and other marine animals in check.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> <em>Sharks have been around for over 400 million years</em>, making them even 
    older than dinosaurs! Many shark species are top predators in the ocean's food chain, which helps to keep marine 
    habitats healthy. However, due to overfishing and habitat destruction, many shark species are now endangered. 
    <span style="color:blue;">It's essential to protect sharks to preserve the ocean's biodiversity.</span></p>
